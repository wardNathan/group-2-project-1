# Emergency Teleport

## Description
Emergency Teleport is a website for the evacuation of Earth for catastrophic asteroids hitting the planet. World ending events need a fast and easy way for people to evacuate without panic. You can go to the emergency teleport website and get a ticket to your new home planet (50 percent chance of survival) and enjoy a nice space picture of the day provided by NASA. The incoming asteroid was also found and tracked by NASA. Your ticket will be presented after filling out a small form and have a nice sticker presented by Giphy.
